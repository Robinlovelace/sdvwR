Endnotes

1. "What kind of a name is R?" common question. R's
    name originates from the creators of R, Ross Ihaka and Robert
    Gentleman. R is an open source implementation of the statistical
    programming language S, so its name is also a play on words that
    makes implicit reference to this.

2. R is notoriously difficult to search for on major search engines, as
    it is such a common letter with many other uses beyond the name of a
    statistical programming language. This should not be a deterrent, as
    R has a wealth of excellent online resources. To overcome the issue,
    you can either be more specific with the search term (e.g. "R
    spatial statistics") or use an R specific search engine such as
    [rseek.org](http://www.rseek.org/). You can also search of online
    help *from within R* using the command `RSiteSearch`. E.g.
    `RSiteSearch("spatial statistics")`. Experiment and see which you
    prefer!

    "download.file("http://www.openstreetmap.org/trace/1619756/data", destfile = "data/gps-trace.gpx")".
    More information about this ride, and a
    [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a8QLiC4LV8&feature=share)
    from it, can be found on
    [robinlovelace.net](http://robinlovelace.net/ecotech/2013/10/13/bicycle-trailer-move.html).
    
4. A complete list of drivers for importing and exporting spatial data can 
    be displayed by typing `getGDALDriverNames()`.
    
5. Slots are elements found 'inside' classes of the 
    [S4 object system](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html). 
    While the sub-elements of S3 objects such as `data.frame` are referred to 
    using the `$` symbol, the slots of S4 objects are identified using `@`.
    Thus, the variable `x` of dataframe `df` can be referred to with `df$x`.
    In the same way, the data associated with a polygon layer such as `lnd` can 
    be accessed with `lnd@data`. Note that `lnd@data` is itself a dataframe, 
    so can be further specified, e.g. with `lnd@data$name`. For more on spatial 
    data classes, see Bivand et al. (2013).
    
6. EPSG stands for "European Petroleum Survey Group", but this is not really worth 
    knowing as the organisation is now defunct ([www.epsg.org/](http://www.epsg.org/)).
    The important thing is that EPSG codes provide a unified way to refer to a 
    wide range of coordinate systems, as each CRS has its own epsg code. 
    These can be found at the website [spatialreference.org](http://spatialreference.org/).
    To see how this website can be useful, try searching for "osgb", for example to 
    find the epsg code for the British National Grid.
    
7. To see how the `crimeAg` dataset was created, please refer to the 
    "Creating-maps-in-R" tutorial (Cheshire and Lovelace, 2014) hosted 
    on [GitHub](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R). 
    The file 
    "[intro-spatial-rl.pdf](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/blob/master/intro-spatial-rl.pdf)" 
    contains this information, 
    in the section on "Downloading addtional data".
